Each profile outlines naming conventions, geopolitical context, motivations, operational patterns, notable campaigns, and implications for defenders. The goal is to give decision-makers, analysts, and technical teams a precise understanding of who these actors are, how they operate, and what their historical behavior indicates about future threats.\n",

    "\n",
    "Qilin, sometimes referenced under the alias **Agenda**, is a financially motivated **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** group known for highly disruptive double-extortion campaigns. Qilin operators research their targets, adapt their intrusion playbook, and tailor malware to the victim’s environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In **June 2024**, Synnovis, a pathology services provider supporting several major **NHS hospitals in London**, suffered a severe ransomware attack. The attackers are believed to be the **Russian-speaking Qilin group**, reportedly demanding a ransom estimated at **£32.7 million**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The incident caused **major disruption to healthcare operations**, taking down Synnovis IT systems and exposing sensitive patient data, affecting diagnostics and routine medical procedures. It was one of the most significant hospital service outages in recent UK history.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What Happened\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Initial Intrusion & Ransomware Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "On **June 3, 2024**, Synnovis discovered that its systems had been encrypted and locked by a ransomware strain. The attackers had infiltrated the environment ahead of time, gained elevated access(administrator-level privileges), and eventually triggered the encryption of servers that support blood testing, pathology analysis, and other essential lab functions. The hospital’s computers and servers were made unusable, files could not be opened, systems could not run, and services were essentially frozen.. \n",
    "\n",
    "Attackers had:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infiltrated the environment beforehand\n",
    "- Gained **administrator-level privileges**\n",
    "- Triggered encryption on servers supporting blood testing, pathology analysis, and other essential lab functions\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of locking everything, the attackers also stole about 400GB of sensitive data. This data included patient names, dates of birth, NHS numbers, information about blood tests, and even financial documents between Synnovis and NHS partners. So the impact was double: the systems were taken down and confidential patient data was taken out of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files unusable, systems frozen\n",
    "- **400GB of sensitive data stolen**, including patient names, dates of birth, NHS numbers, blood test info, and financial documents\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Preparation \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the compromise, Synnovis — like many healthcare partners — may have faced::\n",
    "\n",
    "- Legacy systems (typical in NHS pathology)\n",
    "- High reliance on third-party systems (multiple NHS Trusts)\n",
    "- Public-facing services possibly lacking **MFA**\n",
    "- Flat network segments enabling lateral movement\n",
    "- Limited **24/7 monitoring**\n",

    "These factors made Synnovis a **high-impact, high-profit target** for Qilin.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Reconnaissance \n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible Recon Methods**:\n",
